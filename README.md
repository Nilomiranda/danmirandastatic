## I'm finally startinga  blog, and for this I decided to build it with Gatsby due to experiments I've been running and I'm completely convinced that this is the stack I'll use

I'm using Gatsby starter blog https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/ to get this
up and running, but in the future I'll keep adding my tweaks to make it look more personal and exclusive
