# Repository for danmiranda.io ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

## I'm finally starting a blog, and for this I decided to build it with Gatsby due to experiments I've been running and I'm completely convinced that this is the stack I'll use

I'm using Gatsby starter blog https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/ to get this
up and running, but in the future I'll keep adding my tweaks to make it look more personal and exclusive

## I would like you help as well

As I'm learning all these technologies to build this blog on the go, please feel free to send me some PR's
or hit me on Twitter with tips to help me improve this site. I'll make sure to add a honored mention about you in the contributions page
